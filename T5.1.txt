Task 2 Question:
Based on your results, are any of the LPs linearly separable? If so, which one?

Of the three learning problems, only one (Iris Setosa) was able to be classified
perfectly using the perceptron. The other flowers however were unable to remove all
errors and stabilized their results after several epochs. This means that the target
Iris Setosa is linearly separable, however the others are not because the perceptron
is not able to capture them perfectly using a linear combination.
