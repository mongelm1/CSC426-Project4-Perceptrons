Task 3 Analysis:

The graphs generated from task 3 appear to start and finish with 
more errors per epoch than those in task 2. In task 1, each learning
problem finished with less than 10 errors per epoch. However, in task 3 
(except for Iris Setosa which still classifies all examples correctly)
the Versicolor and Viriginica learning problems end with, on average,
more errors per epoch and start with a much higher number of errors. 
Versicolor and Viriginica started with about 100 errors on the first epoch
for each learning problem of Task 3.
