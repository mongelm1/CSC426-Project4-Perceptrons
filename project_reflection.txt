(1) anything positive you enjoyed or learned from this assignment
    - I enjoyed implementing this project, I created the perceptron class right 
    after lecture finished because I was interested
    - It was very satisfying to get the perceptron training rule running

(2) anything negative you didn't like about this assignment
    - None

(3) any parts of this assignment you found easy
    - I found it very straightforward to implement this project based on our class notes

(4) any parts of this assignment you found challenging or couldn't get working correctly
    - I did find some difficulty intially with the perceptron training rule algorithm
    - At first I didn't understand how we would teach it to classify each flower differently,
    but then I realized each flower had to be learned separately and the the algorithm could
    only classify based on that one flower as 1 (the flower is the target) or -1 (the flower is
    not the target)

(5) how your team functioned, including details such as what each team member contributed, how the team communicated with each other, and how team software development & design was accomplished
    - As I discussed in my email, I tried to get an early start on this project with my original group but
    by the time they were available to work on it it was already mostly done being coded
    - I split off to make my own submission

(6) any other remarks you want to make
    - None
